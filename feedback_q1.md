In the class Tester, there are following issues in the functions: 

1. def iterative_mult(w) :
* Needs to be changed to def iterative_mult(self, w)
* you shouldn't set the variable sum to 0 at the beginning of the loop. It should only be initialised to 0 once, outside the loop
* A matrix is stored in a "row-major" form, and w is a row vector itself, so in the code you are multiplying two rows together. In matrix multiplication, you need to multiply row by column.
* You need to return the variable you have computed at the end of the function

2. def matrix_mult(w) :
* Unattempted

3. def comparison(w) :
* Unattempted

4. Plotting
* Unattempted
